**Project Name: Predicting Battery Range for an Electric Self-Driving Car**
 
# Problem: 
 Electric self-driving cars face the challenge of accurately predicting their remaining battery range. This is a critical issue as inaccurate predictions can lead to inconvenient stops and route disruptions. Factors like battery health, driving conditions, and real-time data are often not adequately considered by existing methods. To address this, the project aims to create a precise battery range prediction system. By employing advanced machine learning techniques and incorporating diverse data sources, such as vehicle sensors and historical driving patterns, we aim to develop a model that can forecast battery range reliably. The goal is to improve the reliability and convenience of electric self-driving cars, advancing sustainable transportation solutions.

# Solution:
 To tackle the challenge of accurately predicting the battery range for electric self-driving cars, our project employs cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We gather extensive data, including real-time vehicle sensor data and historical driving behavior, to train a robust predictive model. This model considers factors such as battery health, weather, traffic conditions, and driving habits. It continuously updates its predictions during the journey, ensuring precision. By integrating this solution into self-driving car systems, we aim to enhance the reliability and convenience of electric vehicle travel. Our approach contributes to safer and more efficient transportation, aligning with the broader vision of sustainable and dependable mobility solutions.
